change the value of c0, c1 and s0,s1 in the code to get the resulet for different inputs

for exmaple, the uploaded code, works only for m=0,certain suction coefficient(can find vlaues at book) and any prandtl value

couldn't find certain values that gives result for any input parameters, so maybe using python was not a good idea for this problem
